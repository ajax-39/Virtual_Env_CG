### Performance Considerations

1. **Post-Processing:** Can impact FPS on lower-end devices

   - Toggle with `P` to disable if needed
   - SSAO is performance-intensive

2. **Particle Systems:**

   - Rain: 2000 particles
   - Fountain: 300 particles
   - Total manageable on modern hardware

3. **AI Updates:**

   - All NPCs update every frame
   - Optimized pathfinding
   - State-based behavior reduces computation

4. **Wildlife:**
   - Predefined paths for efficiency
   - Minimal physics calculations
